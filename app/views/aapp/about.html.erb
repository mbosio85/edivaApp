		<h4>About eDiVa </h4>
		<p>
		Exome Disease Variant analysis (eDiVa), is a variant annotation and prioritization pipleint which integrates multiple reliable information sources to better assess variants deleteriousness.
		<br/>
		It integrates multiple damage predictors into one single score and helps researchers with an easy-to-use workflow to decide for potentially disease causing genic variants.
		Information from human genome and transcriptome sequencing, data from different omics platforms and clinical data need to be integrated in order to support the analysis of rare and complex diseases. 
		This project developed anintegrated platform supporting the collection and storage of genome variation, expression, 
		omics and clinical data to provide diagnostics assistance, to elucidate pathogenicity and to identify causal coding gene mutations.
