			<p>
				eDiVA’s causal variant analysis consists of three steps, 1) uploading the variant file in VCF format, 2) functional annotation of the variants and 
				ranking by eDiVA’s pathogenicity score, and 3) prioritization using segregation and clinical information (phenotypes). After logging into eDiVa, start 
				with uploading the VCF file containing variants for a single case, a parent-child trio or a larger family. Trio and family variants need to be provided 
				as multi-sample VCF file ( click 
			<%= link_to :here, "http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41", target: "_blank", class: "nav_links_body"%> 
			for information on VCF file format). Uploaded files will appear in the workspace section, which occupies the 
				lower half of the browser page. The workspace will also contain all result files generated by eDiVA. Second, select the VCF file in dropdown menu 
				of the Step 2: Annotate section and press the Submit button. The annotation step will require a few minutes to compute and an email is sent once the step 
				is finished. You can also press the reload button of the browser after a few minutes and the annotated variant file should appear in the workspace section. 
				Third, select the annotated variant file in the dropdown menu of the Step 3: Prioritization section and press the Submit button.

				<%= image_tag('gs3.png', :border => { :width => 2, :color => 'black' }) %>
			</p>
			<p>
				Pressing the Submit button of Step 3: Prioritization will load a new page for causal variant prioritization analysis. Here please select the inheritance type, or 
				select ‘all’ for running the prioritization for each type in one go. Second, select the type of segregation analysis (single case, trio or family). For single cases 
				segregation is turned off. In the sample section, select the samples that are affected by the disease. Finally, please use the text box to specify the disease phenotypes 
				in form of HPO terms (one HPO ID per line). Follow the link next to the text box to use an external HPO term search interface  to obtain suitable HPO terms. Finally, 
				choose to exclude or to keep black-listed genes, which are known to frequently show up as false positive candidates. Press the submit button to start the analysis. This 
				will bring the user back to eDiVA’s workspace page, were the result file of the prioritization will be found after a few minutes of computation. Again, an email is 
				sent to the user once the computation has been finished.

			Getting started with uploading & management of files and analyses
		</h3>
		
		</br>
		
		<p>		
			After logging into eDiVa, you can upload and manage your files in your home page. On the right hand side of your home page,
			you can see the forms for uplaoding your files and below that you can perform basic tasks (e.g viewing, deleting and downloading)
			on your uploaded files in your workspace. The main portion of your home page shows the files you currently have in your workspace.
			 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Also, immediately below the file management section on the right hand side of your home page, you can see the analyses that you can do using
			eDiVa app. You can annotate your genomic variants and calculate the eDiVA-Score for all of them using the <b>Annotate Variants</b> section. 
			Finally, Step 3 Analyze lets you perform multiple inheritence testing in small families and trios to detect susceptible genes. 
			This analysis step works on  a single merged VCF file (multi-sample VCF file, click 
			<%= link_to :here, "http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41", target: "_blank", class: "nav_links_body"%> 
			for information on VCF file format) containing genotypes of differnet samples per variant line. All analyses work 
			with both Single nucleotide variants and short insertion-deletion variants.

		<h3>
			Performing analyses on eDiVa
		</h3>
		
		</br>
		
		<p>		
                    Running analyses in eDiVa can be done in few steps: Upload, Annotate, and Prioritize. To run the
                    annotation task, you can directly upload a VCF file or you can also select a VCF file from your
                    workspace; There is an option to load example data of a publicly available trio. Emails are sent to your
                    email address as soon as the task is completed.			 
		</p>		
		
		<p>
                     For running Trio/Family prioritization step, you can select the inheritance type and family type. In this
                     step it is required for you to mark the affected samples by selecting the checkbox next to the ID.
                     Moreover, you can choose a file with HPO terms for the disease to flag variants in genes related to the
                     HPO terms. You can also specify to use an exclusion list for genes already marked as false positives in
                     previous studies.
