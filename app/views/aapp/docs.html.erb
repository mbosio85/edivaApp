			Getting started with uploading & management of files and analyses
		</h3>
		
		</br>
		
		<p>		
			After logging into eDiVa, you can upload and manage your files in your home page. On the right hand side of your home page,
			you can see the forms for uplaoding your files and below that you can perform basic tasks (e.g viewing, deleting and downloading)
			on your uploaded files in your workspace. The main portion of your home page shows the files you currently have in your workspace.
			 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Also, immediately below the file management section on the right hand side of your home page, you can see the analyses that you can do using
			eDiVa app. You can annotate your genomic variants and calculate the eDiVA-Score for all of them using the <b>Annotate Variants</b> section. 
			Finally, Step 3 Analyze lets you perform multiple inheritence testing in small families and trios to detect susceptible genes. 
			This analysis step works on  a single merged VCF file (multi-sample VCF file, click 
			<%= link_to :here, "http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41", target: "_blank", class: "nav_links_body"%> 
			for information on VCF file format) containing genotypes of differnet samples per variant line. All analyses work 
			with both Single nucleotide variants and short insertion-deletion variants.

		<h3>
			Performing analyses on eDiVa
		</h3>
		
		</br>
		
		<p>		
                    Running analyses in eDiVa can be done in few steps: Upload, Annotate, and Prioritize. To run the
                    annotation task, you can directly upload a VCF file or you can also select a VCF file from your
                    workspace; There is an option to load example data of a publicly available trio. Emails are sent to your
                    email address as soon as the task is completed.			 
		</p>		
		
		<p>
                     For running Trio/Family prioritization step, you can select the inheritance type and family type. In this
                     step it is required for you to mark the affected samples by selecting the checkbox next to the ID.
                     Moreover, you can choose a file with HPO terms for the disease to flag variants in genes related to the
                     HPO terms. You can also specify to use an exclusion list for genes already marked as false positives in
                     previous studies.
